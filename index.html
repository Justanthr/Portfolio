        My dad majored in Computer Science, so all of my childhood I watched get
        computers to do exactily what he wanted. A prime example of this would
        be when he took a 1990s era laptop, that could
        <em>barely</em> load Chrome, running on Windows 7, and got it running
        Windows 10 smoothly, and quickly! He is a major insporation, and is the
        reason I am learning software development.

        My dream, if you don't already know, is to work for Nintendo. They were
        a huge part of my childhood; the first game console I played on was the
        Super Nintendo, then closely followed by the GameCube. This may be a
        product of what my parents would buy, game wise, but it made quite the
        impression.
