        I'm learning programming because I'm going to work for Nintendo someday.
        I will live my dream.

        My dad majored in Computer Science, so all of my childhood I watched him
        get computers to do exactily what he wanted. A prime example of this
        would be when he took a 1990s era laptop, that could
        <em>barely</em> load Chrome, running on Windows 7, and got it running
        Windows 10 smoothly, and quickly! He is a major insporation, and is the
        reason I am learning software development.

        I am obcessed with Nintendo, and know, maybe a bit too much, about the
        history of the company.
